// ===========================================================================
// REAL-TIME (Socket.IO)
//
// What it does: when a task changes, everyone who is allowed to see that task's owner is told "something
// changed" and their page re-asks the normal API. The socket carries a SIGNAL, never task content, so the
// database stays the single source of truth and no sensitive data travels over it.
//
// Who hears what — decided on the SERVER, never by the client:
//   * a socket is authenticated with the same bearer token as the REST API (handshake `auth.token`), and the
//     live user row is checked exactly as `requireAuth` does (suspended / exited / closed company / wrong
//     pinned company are refused);
//   * each socket is put into one room per PERSON whose task events it may receive:
//       employee            -> only themselves
//       manager / HR / admin -> the people the existing `manageableUserIds` rule gives them (plus themselves)
//   * a client cannot join, leave or name a room. The only thing it may send is `resync` ("recompute my rooms"),
//     which takes no arguments, is rate-limited, and is answered from the database again;
//   * rights are re-checked every few minutes, so a suspended or demoted user is cut off without waiting for a
//     token to expire.
//
// If the socket is down the pages keep working: they fall back to ordinary polling (see the frontend hook).
// One backend instance needs no adapter. With several instances behind a load balancer, add the Redis adapter
// (`@socket.io/redis-adapter`) so events reach sockets connected to another instance.
