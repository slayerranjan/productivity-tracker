// The SLA watcher in onboarding.scheduler.ts measures HR's delay. This
// measures the candidate's: how long since we created their account while
// they still have documents outstanding.
//
// Stateless by design. The watcher ticks every 15 minutes (0.25h), so the
// 24h mail fires only inside [24, 24.25) and the 48h mail inside [48, 48.25).
// Each window can be hit exactly once, so no "reminded" column and no
// migration is needed. Cost: a reminder is missed if the backend is down
// during its window, and a restart inside a window can double-send. For a
// nudge that is an acceptable trade; for anything legal it would not be.
